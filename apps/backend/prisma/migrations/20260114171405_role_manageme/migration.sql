  - The primary key for the `Role` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to alter the column `id` on the `Role` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `String` to `Int`.
  - The primary key for the `UserRole` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to alter the column `roleId` on the `UserRole` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `String` to `Int`.
